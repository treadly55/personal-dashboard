# Chrome Extension that displays background photos, weather, etc on the opening tab

## This 'dashboard' works on Chrome as an extension which displays on the opening tab, or empty tab when the user starts. The extension utilizes a number of APIs to source photos, jokes, weather and trivia. 

This project is an open source project to allows users to use free information sourced through APIs to display an professional and clean looking dashboard when the user starts their Chrome browser, or when they open a new tab on the browser. Each 'module' has an error state in case the user exceeds the usage limits and utilizes location services to set the weather.

Some features: 

- Show / hide photo in full screen with delicate fade in/out of modules 
- Interactive trivia module
- Location services will automatically assign weather location and error handling allows user to retry allowing location if denied accidentally.
- Really funny jokes
